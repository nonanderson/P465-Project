    <h1>Meet the Team </h1>
    <h2>Committed to the ease and simplicity that rentals <i>should</i> be</h2>

    <p>Dev. Team: Nona Anderson, Tanner Hay, Adam Martinez, Connor Stacey</p>
    <p>This website has been created because our team saw a problem with the rental process.
        Rather than having to deal with different realtors, the uncertainty of your staying
        time, or just general stressors surrounding finding a new environment to call your own,
        we are committed to empowering and motivating our cilents throughout that process. 
        We want potential rental buyers to feel actually excited about a new home rather than 
        dread the upcoming process of searching.</p>
